"Michelle McCool was the first WWE Diva to claim the Divas Championship in July 2008 at The Great American Bash. Since then, several Divas won the coveted butterfly, including Maryse and Melina, who each held it twice. Michelle unified the Divas Championship and the Women's Championship at Night of Champions in September 2010 when she defeated Melina with the help of Layla to become the first-ever Unified Divas Champion."
