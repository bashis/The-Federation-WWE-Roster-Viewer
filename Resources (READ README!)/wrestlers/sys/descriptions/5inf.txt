"While the WWE Tag Team Championship only dates back to 2002, it is still considered one of the most prestigious championships in the history of tag team wrestling. The championship got its start after it was decided that the World Tag Team Championship would be exclusive to the Raw brand. After this announcement, then-SmackDown General Manager Stephanie McMahon created her own version of the World Tag Team Championship. She then declared that the first champions would be the duo that survived a brutal tournament. Since that time, many great tag teams have staked claim to the prestigious championship, including John Morrison & The Miz and Los Guerreros. The WWE Tag Team Championship was previously known as the Unified Tag Team Championship when it was combined with the World Tag Team Championship at the 25th Anniversary of WrestleMania."
